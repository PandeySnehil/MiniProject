# HealChain – A Blockchain-Based Electronic Health Record System

**HealChain** is a decentralized, patient-centric Electronic Health Record (EHR) management system built using Ethereum smart contracts, IPFS, and MongoDB. It empowers patients to control their medical data while ensuring transparency, integrity, and interoperability in healthcare systems.

## 📌 Objective

Develop a secure, scalable, and decentralized EHR system that allows:
- Patients to control who accesses their health data
- Healthcare providers to interact with verified EHRs
- Secure, immutable audit trails for every interaction

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Flask  
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity, Ganache  
- **Storage**: IPFS for document storage  
- **Database**: MongoDB for metadata  
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption, smart contract-based access control

---

## 🏗️ Features

- ✅ Patient login & dashboard  
- ✅ Role-based access management for doctors  
- ✅ Real-time authorization & revocation of EHR access  
- ✅ Secure EHR upload/download  
- ✅ Immutable audit trail with blockchain logging  
- ✅ Interoperability using FHIR/HL7 standards
